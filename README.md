# covid-19 dataset [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/allixsenos/covid-19.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/allixsenos/covid-19)

This repo serves as the datasource for my [COVID-19 in Croatia](https://bit.ly/luka-covid19-dash) dashboard.

It rebuilds daily from [official data published by the Croatian government](https://www.koronavirus.hr/podaci/otvoreni-strojno-citljivi-podaci/526).

Should I have more time and the COVID-19 nonsense continue further, I might expand this approach to other countries, and my dashboard to support switching between them. Maybe..
